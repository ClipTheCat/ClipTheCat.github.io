                <p>Beyond the statistics, there are numerous stories of bike helmets being the only barrier between life and death in serious accidents.</p>
                <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was in a bike accident in June of 2024. He has since made several posts advocating for helmets and attributing his helmet to saving his life, saying “Please, please, please, please wear a helmet. Because if I didn't, honestly, I wouldn't be here now.”</p>
                <p>In March of 2025 in Eagan, Minnesota, a toddler was riding a scooter and was struck by a car. The three-year-old was wearing a bike helmet, which ultimately saved his life.</p>
                <p>A woman in British Columbia was in an accident in 2018- while biking home from the grocery store, she was hit and run over by a pickup truck. Despite the truck running over her head, completely mangling her helmet, she left the experience with no head injuries at all.</p>
