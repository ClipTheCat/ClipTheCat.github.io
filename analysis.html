                <t2>How well do bike helmets really work?</t2>
                <p>Bike helmets have proven to be very effective in minimizing the number and severity of bike accidents.</p>
                <p>
                    - According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, helmets reduce serious head injuries by 60% and 79% of cyclist in fatal accidents between 2010-2017 weren’t wearing helmets<br>
                    - After analyzing over 40 unique studies, the International Journal of Epidemiology found that helmets greatly reduce the risk of head injuries in bicycle accidents<br>
                    - According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, bicycle head injuries are 3x as likely to be fatal if cyclists aren’t wearing helmets</p>
                <p>There are many strong arguments to wear a helmet at all times when using a bike, proven through both theory and decades of real-world data.</p>
                <t2>Costs, downsides, and resistances to use</t2>
                <p>Despite those statistics, it was found in 2017 that only 45.5% of Canadians regularly wore helmets while riding bicycles, while 30.9% of Canadians never wore them at all. This can be attributed to various factors.</p>
                <p>Bike helmets typically cost between $50-$200, although some higher-end helmets can cost upwards of $400. Another possibility is the discomfort and inconvenience of using and carrying around the helmet. In combination with other factors, some people may simply not understand how important a helmet is in the event of an accident involving the head, and allow the inconveniences of attaining and using a helmet to outweight the benefits.</p>
                <p>It is important to work to overcome these barriers, as making the use of bike helmets more widespread can save lives. Costs can be reduced, and efforts to educate the public about the effectiveness of bike helmets can be made.</p>
