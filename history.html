                Cycling started to grow in popularity in the 1880s<br>
                Pith helmets were used, because pith was readily available and would break apart after the first impact and would need to be replaced

                The first helmets built specifically for cycling were created. They were originally leather with a halo-shaped ring with wool on top<br>
                They were then updated to provide better ventilation and more straps (filled with cotton and wool)<br>
                At this point, they were known as "cycling hairnets"<br>
                Sweat would cause the leather to break down<br>
                The helmets werenâ€™t very effective (only really provided a physical barrier so the ears and faces of cyclists were protected from sliding across pavement)
