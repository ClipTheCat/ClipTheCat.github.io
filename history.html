            <p>
                Cycling started to grow in popularity in the 1880s. Pith helmets were used, because pith was readily available and would break apart after the first impact and would need to be replaced.

            <t2>Early 1900s</t2>
            <p>
                The first helmets built specifically for cycling were created. They were originally leather with a halo-shaped ring with wool on top. 
                They were then updated to provide better ventilation and more straps (filled with cotton and wool). At this point, they were known as "cycling hairnets".
                These were not as effective as today's helmets, only providing a physical barrier to prevent sliding one's head against the ground. 
                Additionally, sweat would cause the leather to break down.
            </p>
            <t2>1970s</t2>
            <p>
                Early versions of the modern bike helemt were developed in this time. These helmets started to incorporate more material, commonly foam, meant to absorb impact energy.

            <t2>1980s</t2>
            <p>
                The American National Standards Institute created bike helmet standards for the U.S. This weeded out unsafe helmet designs, leading to changes in the design and robustness of helmets.
                However, as with the development of many other types of safety regulations and technologies, it was not immediately adopted. Some issues like helmets being too heavy was a concern among users.
                It was also during this time that developments were made, such as inreasing how aerodynamic helmets were. 
            </p>
            <t2>1990s - present</t2>
            <p>
                The older materials in bike helmets began being replaced with more modern ones, such as including plastic. However, the fundamental idea has remained the same since the 1970s.
